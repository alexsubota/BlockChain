## System requirement <a name="System requirement"></a>

For best performance in enterprise production environments, Ripple recommends running rippled on bare metal with the following characteristics:
- Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04+
- CPU: Intel Xeon 3+ GHz processor with 4 cores and hyperthreading enabled
- Disk: SSD
- RAM:
	- For testing: 8GB+
	- For production: 32GB
- Network: Enterprise data center network with a gigabit network interface on the host

##Object types

### Ledger

Parts of ledger:
   1. A header - The **ledger index**, hashes of its other contents, and other metadata.
   2. A transaction tree - The **transactions** that were applied to the previous ledger to make this one. Transactions are the only way to change the ledger.
   3. A state tree - All the **ledger** objects that contain the settings, balances, and objects in the ledger as of this version

##### Header of ledger

| <center>Field          | <center>Type    | <center>Description |
|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| ledger_index | String  | The sequence number of the ledger.    |
| ledger_hash  | String  | The SHA-512Half of the ledger header, excluding the ledger_hash itself.   |
| account_hash | String  | The SHA-512Half of this ledger's state tree information. |
|close_time    | Number  | The approximate time this ledger closed, as the number of seconds since the Ripple Epoch of 2000-01-01 00:00:00. This value is rounded based on the close_time_resolution|
|closed|Boolean| If true, this ledger version is no longer accepting new transactions.|
|parent_hash| String| The ledger_hash value of the previous ledger that was used to build this one.|
|total_coins| String| The total number of drops of XRP owned by accounts in the ledger. This omits XRP that has been destroyed by transaction fees. The actual amount of XRP in circulation is lower because some accounts are "black holes" whose keys are not known by anyone.|
|transaction_hash| String| The SHA-512Half of the transactions included in this ledger.|
|close_time_resolution| Number|An integer in the range [2,120] indicating the maximum number of seconds by which the close_time could be rounded.|
|close_flags| | A bit-map of flags relating to the closing of this ledger|

##### State tree

|<center>Type    | <center>Description|
|----------------|--------------------|
|AccountRoot| The settings, XRP balance, and other metadata for one account.|
|Amendments | Singleton object with status of enabled and pending amendments.|
|Check|A check that can be redeemed for money by its destination|
|DirectoryNode | Contains links to other objects.|
|Escrow | Contains XRP held for a conditional payment.|
|FeeSettings | Singleton object with consensus-approved base transaction cost and reserve requirements.|
|LedgerHashes | Lists of prior ledger versions' hashes for history lookup.|
|Offer | An offer to exchange currencies, known in finance as an order.|
|PayChannel | A channel for asynchronous XRP payments.|
|RippleState | Links two accounts, tracking the balance of one currency between them. The concept of a trust line is really an abstraction of this object type.|
|SignerList | A list of addresses for multi-signing transactions.|

##Transactions

###Common Field

| Field   | Type | Description|
|---------|------|------------|
| Account |  String | The unique address of the account that initiated the transaction.|
|AccountTxnID| String |	(Optional) Hash value identifying another transaction. This transaction is only valid if the sending account's previously-sent transaction matches the provided hash.|
|Fee|String|(Required, but auto-fillable) Integer amount of XRP, in drops, to be destroyed as a cost for distributing this transaction to the network.|
|Flags|Unsigned Integer|(Optional) Set of bit-flags for this transaction.|
|LastLedgerSequence	|Number|(Optional, but strongly recommended) Highest ledger sequence number that a transaction can appear in.|
|Memos|Array of Objects|(Optional) Additional arbitrary information used to identify this transaction.|
|Sequence|Unsigned Integer|	(Required, but auto-fillable) The sequence number, relative to the initiating account, of this transaction. A transaction is only valid if the Sequence number is exactly 1 greater than the last-valided transaction from the same account.|
|SigningPubKey|String|(Automatically added when signing) Hex representation of the public key that corresponds to the private key used to sign this transaction. If an empty string, indicates a multi-signature is present in the Signers field instead.|
|Signers|Array|(Optional) Array of objects that represent a multi-signature which authorizes this transaction.|
|SourceTag|Unsigned Integer|(Optional) Arbitrary integer used to identify the reason for this payment, or a sender on whose behalf this transaction is made. Conventionally, a refund should specify the initial payment's SourceTag as the refund payment's DestinationTag.|
|TransactionType|String|The type of transaction.|
|TxnSignature	|String|(Automatically added when signing) The signature that verifies this transaction as originating from the account it says it is from|

#####Memos

|MemoFormat	|String	|Hex value representing characters allowed in URLs. Conventionally containing information on how the memo is encoded, for example as a MIME type.|
|MemoType |String	|Hex value representing characters allowed in URLs. Conventionally, a unique relation (according to RFC 5988) that defines the format of this memo.|

#####Signers Field

|Field	|Type	|Description|
|-------|-------|-----------|
|Account |String |The address associated with this signature, as it appears in the SignerList.|
|TxnSignature |String |A signature for this transaction, verifiable using the SigningPubKey.|

##Data API

The Ripple Data API provides access to information about changes in the XRP Ledger, including transaction history and processed analytical data. This information is stored in a dedicated database, which frees rippled servers to keep fewer historical ledger versions.

#####Get Ledger

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-------|-------|-----------|
|ledger_identifier	|Ledger Hash, Ledger Index, or Timestamp	|(Optional) An identifier for the ledger to retrieve: either the full hash in hex, an integer sequence number, or a date-time. If a date-time is provided, retrieve the ledger that was most recently closed at that time. If omitted, retrieve the latest validated ledger.|

Optionally, you can provide the following query parameters:

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-------|-------|-----------|
|transactions	|Boolean	|If true, include the identifying hashes of all transactions that are part of this ledger.|

##API Conventions

###Basic Types
As a REST API, the Data API v2 uses JSON's native datatypes to represent API fields, with some special cases.

#####Numbers and Precision
XRP Ledger APIs generally use strings, rather than native JSON numbers, to represent numeric amounts of currency for both XRP and issued currencies. This protects against a loss of precision when using JSON parsers, which may automatically try to represent all JSON numbers in a floating-point format. Within the String value, the numbers are serialized in the same way as native JSON numbers:

- Base-10.
- Non-zero-prefaced.
- May contain `.` as a decimal point. For example, ½ is represented as 0.5. (American style, not European)
- May contain `E` or `e` to indicate being raised to a power of 10 (scientific notation). For example, `1.2E5` is equivalent to `1.2×105`, or `120000`.
- No comma (`,`) characters are used.

The precision for amounts of non-XRP currency in the XRP Ledger is as follows:

- Minimum nonzero absolute value: `1000000000000000e-96`
- Maximum value: `9999999999999999e80`
- Minimum value: `-9999999999999999e80`
- 15 decimal digits of precision

XRP has a different internal representation, and its precision is different:

- Minimum value: `0`
- Maximum value: `100000000000` (`1e11`)
- Precise to the nearest `0.000001` (`1e-6`)

In other words, XRP has the same precision as a 64-bit unsigned integer where each unit is equivalent to 0.000001 XRP.

#####Addresses
Accounts in the XRP Ledger are identified by a base58 XRP Ledger Address. The address is derived from the account's master public key, which is in turn derived from a secret key. An address is represented as a string in JSON and has the following characteristics:

- Between 25 and 35 characters in length
- Starts with the character `r`
- Uses alphanumeric characters, excluding the number "`0`" capital letter "`O`", capital letter "`I`", and lowercase letter "`l`"
- Case-sensitive
- Includes a 4-byte checksum so that the probability of generating a valid address from random characters is approximately `1` in `2^32`

#####Public Keys
The XRP Ledger uses public keys to verify cryptographic signatures in several places:

- To authorize transactions, a public key is attached to the transaction. The public key must be mathematically associated with the sending XRP Ledger address or the sender's regular key address.
- To secure peer-to-peer communications between rippled servers. This uses a "node public key" that the server generates randomly when it starts with an empty database.
- To sign validation votes as part of the consensus process. This uses a "validator public key" that the server operator defines in the config file.

Validator public keys and node public keys use the exact same format.

Public keys can be represented in hexadecimal or in base-58. In hexadecimal, all three types of public keys are 33 bytes (66 characters) long.

In base-58 format, validator public keys and node public keys always start with the character n, commonly followed by the character `9`. A validator public key in base-58 format can be up to 53 characters long. Example node public key: `n9Mxf6qD4J55XeLSCEpqaePW4GjoCR5U1ZeGZGJUCNe3bQa4yQbG`.

XRP Ledger addresses are mathematically associated with a public key. This public key is rarely encoded in base-58, but when it is, it starts with the character `a`.

####Hashes
Many objects in the XRP Ledger, particularly transactions and ledgers, are uniquely identified by a 256-bit hash value. This value is typically calculated as a "SHA-512Half", which calculates a SHA-512 hash from some contents, then takes the first 64 characters of the hexadecimal representation. Since the hash of an object is derived from the contents in a way that is extremely unlikely to produce collisions, two objects with the same hash can be considered the same.

An XRP Ledger hash value has the following characteristics:

- Exactly 64 characters in length
- Hexadecimal character set: 0-9 and A-F.
- Typically written in upper case.

*SHA-512Half has similar security to the officially-defined SHA-512/256 hash function. However, the XRP Ledger's usage predates SHA-512/256 and is also easier to implement on top of an existing SHA-512 function. (As of this writing, SHA-512 support in cryptographic libraries is much more common than for SHA-512/256.)*

#####Timestamps
All dates and times are written in ISO 8601 Timestamp Format, using UTC. This format is summarized as:

`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`

- Four-digit year
- Two-digit month
- Two-digit day
- The letter `T` separating the date part and the time part
- Two-digit hour using a 24-hour clock
- Two digit minute
- The letter `Z` indicating zero offset from UTC.

#####Ledger Index
A ledger index is a 32-bit unsigned integer used to identify a ledger. The ledger index is also known as the ledger's sequence number. The very first ledger was ledger index 1, and each new ledger has a ledger index 1 higher than that of the ledger immediately before it.

The ledger index indicates the order of the ledgers; the Hash value identifies the exact contents of the ledger. Two ledgers with the same hash are always the same. For validated ledgers, hash values and sequence numbers are equally valid and correlate 1:1. However, this is not true for in-progress ledgers:

- Two different rippled servers may have different contents for a current ledger with the same ledger index, due to latency in propagating transactions throughout the network.
- There may be multiple closed ledger versions competing to be validated by consensus. These ledger versions have the same sequence number but different contents (and different hashes). Only one of these closed ledgers can become validated.
- A current ledger's contents change over time, which would cause its hash to change, even though its ledger index number stays the same. The hash of a ledger is not calculated until the ledger is closed.

#####Account Sequence
A Sequence number is a 32-bit unsigned integer used to identify a transaction or Offer relative to a specific account.

Every account object in the XRP Ledger has a Sequence number, which starts at 1. For a transaction to be relayed to the network and possibly included in a validated ledger, it must have a Sequence field that matches the sending account's current Sequence number. An account's Sequence field is incremented whenever a transaction from that account is included in a validated ledger (regardless of whether the transaction succeeded or failed). This preserves the order of transactions submitted by an account, and differentiates transactions that would otherwise be the same.

Every Offer node in the XRP Ledger is marked with the sending `Account` `Address` and the `Sequence` value of the OfferCreate transaction that created it. These two fields, together, uniquely identify the Offer.

#####Currency Code
There are two kinds of currency code in the XRP Ledger:

- Three-character currency code. We recommend using all-uppercase ISO 4217 Currency Codes. However, any combination of the following characters is permitted: all uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, as well as the symbols `?`, `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, and `|`. The currency code `XRP` (all-uppercase) is reserved for XRP and cannot be used by issued currencies.
- 160-bit hexadecimal values, such as `0158415500000000C1F76FF6ECB0BAC600000000`, according to the XRP Ledger's internal Currency Format. This representation is uncommon.

###Pagination
Many queries may return more data than is reasonable to return in a single HTTP response. The Data API uses a "limit and marker" system to control how much is returned in a single response ("page") and to query for additional content.

The `limit` query parameter to many requests restricts the response to a specific number of results in the response. The types of results and default values vary based on the method. For most methods, the limit is **200** by default, and can be set as high as **1000**. If you specify a `limit` larger than the maximum, the API uses the maximum value instead.

When a query has additional objects that are not contained in the current response, the JSON response contains a top-level field `marker` which indicates that you can retrieve additional results. To do so, make more requests with the previous value of the `marker` field as the `marker` query parameter. For each additional request, use the same parameters as the first request (except `marker`). When the response omits the `marker` parameter, that indicates that you have reached the end of the queryable data.

When a `marker` is or would be present, the response contains a `Link header` with `rel="next"`. This is a full URL to the next page of results. You can use this to paginate over results when the response is in `csv` format instead of `json`.

###Transaction Objects
Transactions have two formats - a compact "binary" format where the defining fields of the transaction are encoded as strings of hex, and an expanded format where the defining fields of the transaction are nested as complete JSON objects.

#####Full JSON Format

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|hash	|String - Hash	|An identifying hash value unique to this transaction, as a hex string.|
|date	|String - Timestamp	|The time when this transaction was included in a validated ledger.
|ledger_index	|Number - Ledger Index	|The sequence number of the ledger that included this ledger.|
|tx	|Object	|The fields of this transaction object, as defined by the Transaction Format|
|meta	|Object	|Metadata about the results of this transaction.|

#####Binary Format

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|hash	|String - Hash	|An identifying hash value unique to this transaction, as a hex string.|
|date	|String - Timestamp	|The time when this transaction was included in a validated ledger.|
|ledger_index	|Number - Ledger Index	|The sequence number of the ledger that included this ledger.|
|tx	|String	|The binary data that represents this transaction, as a hexadecimal string.
|meta	|String	|The binary data that represents this transaction's metadata, as a hex string.|

###Ledger Objects

A "ledger" is one version of the shared global ledger. Each ledger object has the following fields:

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|ledger_hash	|String - Hash	|An identifying hash unique to this ledger, as a hex string.|
|ledger_index	|Number - Ledger Index	|The sequence number of the ledger. Each new ledger has a ledger index 1 higher than the ledger that came before it.|
|parent_hash	|String - Hash	|The identifying hash of the previous ledger.|
|total_coins	|String - Number	|The total number of "drops" of XRP still in existence at the time of the ledger. (Each XRP is 1,000,000 drops.)|
|close_time_res	|Number	|The ledger close time is rounded to this many seconds.|
|accounts_hash	|String - Hash	|Hash of the account information contained in this ledger, as hex.|
|transactions_hash	|String - Hash	|Hash of the transaction information contained in this ledger, as hex.|
|close_time	|Number	|When this ledger was closed, in UNIX time.|
|close_time_human	|String - Timestamp	|When this ledger was closed.|

*Ledger close times are approximate, typically rounded to about 10 seconds. Two ledgers could have the same `close_time` values, when their actual close times were several seconds apart. The sequence number (`ledger_index`) of the ledger makes it unambiguous which ledger closed first.*

#####Genesis Ledger
Due to a mishap early in the XRP Ledger's history, ledgers 1 through 32569 were lost. Thus, ledger #32570 is the earliest ledger available anywhere. For purposes of the Data API v2, ledger #32570 is considered the genesis ledger.

###Account Creation Objects
An account creation object represents the action of creating an account in the XRP Ledger. There are two variations, depending on whether the account was already present in ledger 32570, the earliest ledger available. Accounts that were already present in ledger 32570 are termed genesis accounts.

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|address	|String - Address	|The identifying address of this account, in base-58.|
|inception	|String - Timestamp	|The UTC timestamp when the address was funded. For genesis accounts, this is the timestamp of ledger 32570.|

|genesis_index	|Number - Sequence Number	|(Genesis accounts only) The transaction sequence number of the account as of ledger #32570|

###Exchange Objects
An exchange object represents an actual exchange of currency, which can occur in the XRP Ledger as the result of executing either an OfferCreate transaction or a Payment transaction. In order for currency to actually change hands, there must be a previously-unfilled Offer previously placed in the ledger with an OfferCreate transaction.

A single transaction can cause several exchanges to occur. In this case, the sender of the transaction is the taker for all the exchanges, but each exchange has a different provider, currency pair, or both.

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|base_amount	|Number	|The amount of the base currency that was traded.
|counter_amount	|Number	|The amount of the counter currency that was traded.
|rate	|Number	|The amount of the counter currency acquired per 1 unit of the base currency.|

|counter_currency	|String - Currency Code	|The counter currency.|
|counter_issuer	|String - Address	|(Omitted for XRP) The account that issued the counter currency.|
|executed_time	|String - Timestamp	|The time the exchange occurred.|
|ledger_index	|Number - Ledger Index	|The sequence number of the ledger that included this transaction.|
|offer_sequence	|Number - Sequence Number	|The sequence number of the provider's existing offer in the ledger.|
|provider	|String - Address	|The account that had an existing Offer in the ledger.|
|seller	|String - Address	|The account that acquired the counter currency.|
|taker	|String - Address	|The account that sent the transaction which executed this exchange.|
|tx_hash	|String - Hash	|The identifying hash of the transaction that executed this exchange. (Note: This exchange may be one of several executed in a single transaction.)
|tx_type	|String	|The type of transaction that executed this exchange, either Payment or OfferCreate.|

###Reports Objects
Reports objects show the activity of a given account over a specific interval of time, typically a day. Reports have the following fields:

|Field	|Value	|Description|

|high_value_sent	|String - Number	|The largest amount sent in a single transaction, normalized to XRP (as closely as possible).|
|payments	|Array of Payment Summary Objects	|(May be omitted) Array with information on each payment sent or received by the account during this interval.|
|payments_received	|Number	|The number of payments sent to this account. (This only includes payments for which this account was the destination, not payments that only rippled through the account or consumed the account's offers.)|
|payments_sent	|Number	|The number of payments sent by this account.|
|receiving_counterparties	|Array or Number	|If account lists requested, an array of addresses that received payments from this account. Otherwise, the number of different accounts that received payments from this account.|
|sending_counterparties	|Array or Number	|If account lists requested, an array of addresses that sent payments to this account. Otherwise, the number of different accounts that sent payments to this account.|
|total_value	|String - Number	|Sum of total value received and sent in payments, normalized to XRP (as closely as possible).|
|total_value_received	|String - Number	|Sum value of all payments to this account, normalized to XRP (as closely as possible).|
|total_value_sent	|String - Number	|Sum value of all payments from this account, normalized to XRP (as closely as possible).|

###Payment Summary Objects
A Payment Summary Object contains a reduced amount of information about a single payment from the perspective of either the sender or receiver of that payment.

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|tx_hash	|String - Hash	|The identifying hash of the transaction that caused the payment.|
|delivered_amount	|String - Number	|The amount of the destination `currency` actually received by the destination account.|
|currency	|String - Currency |Code	The currency delivered to the recipient of the transaction.|
|issuer	|String - Address	|The gateway issuing the currency, or an empty string for XRP.|
|type	|String	|Either `sent` or `received`, indicating whether the perspective account is sender or receiver of this transaction.|

###Payment Objects
In the Data API, a Payment Object represents an event where one account sent value to another account. This mostly lines up with XRP Ledger transactions of the `Payment` transaction type, except that the Data API does not consider a transaction to be a payment if the sending `Account` and the `Destination` account are the same, or if the transaction failed.

Payment objects have the following fields:

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|amount	|String - Number	|The amount of the destination currency that the transaction was instructed to send. In the case of Partial Payments, this is a "maximum" amount.|
|delivered_amount	|String - Number	|The amount of the destination currency actually received by the destination account.|
|destination_balance_changes	|Array	|Array of balance change objects, indicating all changes made to the destination account's balances.|
|source_balance_changes	|Array	|Array of balance change objects, indicating all changes to the source account's balances (except the XRP transaction cost).|
|transaction_cost	|String - Number	|The amount of XRP spent by the source account on the transaction cost.|
|destination_tag	|Integer	|(May be omitted) A destination tag specified in this payment.|
|source_tag	|Integer	|(May be omitted) A source tag specified in this payment.|

|source	|String - Address	|The account that sent the payment.|
|source_currency	|String - Currency Code	|The currency that the source account spent.
|tx_hash	|String - Hash	|The identifying hash of the transaction that caused the payment.|

###Balance Objects and Balance Change Objects
Balance objects represent an XRP Ledger account's balance in a specific currency with a specific counterparty at a single point in time. Balance change objects represent a change to such balances that occurs in transaction execution.

A single XRP Ledger transaction may cause changes to balances with several counterparties, as well as changes to XRP.

Balance objects and Balance Change objects have the same format, with the following fields:

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|counterparty	|String - Address	|The counterparty, or issuer, of the `currency`. In the case of XRP, this is an empty string.|
|currency	|String - Currency Code	|The currency for which this balance changed.|
|value	|String - Number	|The amount of the `currency` that the associated account gained or lost. In balance change objects, this value can be positive (for amounts gained) or negative (for amounts lost). In balance objects, this value can be positive (for amounts the counterparty owes the account) or negative (for amounts owed to the counterparty).

###Balance Change Descriptors
Balance Change Descriptors are objects that describe and analyze a single balance change that occurs in transaction execution. They represent the same events as balance change objects, but in greater detail.

Balance Change Descriptors have the following fields:

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|amount_change	|String - Number	|The difference in the amount of currency held before and after this change.|
|final_balance	|String - Number	|The balance after the change occurred.|
|node_index	|Number (or null)	|This balance change is represented by the entry at this index of the ModifiedNodes array within the metadata section of the transaction that executed this balance change. Note: When the transaction cost is combined with other changes to XRP balance, the transaction cost has a node_index of null instead.|
|tx_index	|Number	|The transaction that executed this balance change is at this index in the array of transactions for the ledger that included it.|
|change_type	|String	|One of several describing what caused this balance change to occur.|
|currency	|String - Currency Code	|The change affected this currency.|
|executed_time	|String - Timestamp	|The time the change occurred. (This is based on the close time of the ledger that included the transaction that executed the change.|
|counterparty	|String - Address	|(Omitted for XRP) The `currency` is held in a trust line to or from this account. |
|ledger_index	|Number - Ledger Index	|The sequence number of the ledger that included the transaction that executed this balance change.|
|tx_hash	|String - Hash	|The identifying hash of the transaction that executed this balance change.|

#####Change Types
The following values are valid for the change_type field of a Balance Change Descriptor:

|Value	|Meaning|
|-|-|
|transaction_cost	|This balance change reflects XRP that was destroyed to relay a transaction.|
|payment_destination	|This balance change reflects currency that was received from a payment.|
|payment_source	|This balance change reflects currency that was spent in a payment.|
|exchange	|This balance change reflects currency that was traded for other currency, or the same currency from a different issuer. This can occur in the middle of payment execution as well as from offers.|

###Volume Objects
Volume objects represent the total volumes of money moved, in either payments or exchanges, during a given period.

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|components	|Array of Objects	|The data that was used to assemble this total. For payment volume, each object represents payments in a particular currency and issuer. For exchange volume, each object represents a market between two currencies.|
|count	|Number	|The total number of exchanges in this period.|
|endTime	|String - Timestamp	|The end time of this interval.|
|exchange	|Object	|Indicates the display `currency` used, as with fields currency and (except for XRP) `issuer`. All amounts are normalized by first converting to XRP, and then to the display currency specified in the request.|
|exchangeRate	|Number	|The exchange rate to the displayed currency from XRP.|
|startTime	|String - Timestamp	|The start of this period.|
|total	|Number	|Total volume of all recorded exchanges in the period.|

###Server Objects
A "Server Object" describes one rippled server in the XRP Ledger peer-to-peer network. Server objects are returned by the Get Topology, Get Toplogy Nodes, and Get Topology Node methods. The Data API collects reported network topology approximately every 30 seconds using the peer crawler.

Server objects have the following fields, with some only appearing if the request specified a verbose response:

|Field	|Value	|Description|
|-|-|-|
|node_public_key	|String - Base-58 Public Key	|The public key used by this server to sign its peer-to-peer communications, not including validations.|
